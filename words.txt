"Just then, they discovered thirty or forty windmills in that plain. And as soon
as don Quixote saw them, he said to his squire: “Fortune is guiding our affairs
better than we could have ever hoped. Look over there, Sancho Panza, my friend,
where there are thirty or more monstrous giants with whom I plan to do battle and
take all their lives, and with their spoils we’ll start to get rich. This is righteous
warfare, and it’s a great service to God to rid the earth of such a wicked seed.”

“What giants?” said Sancho Panza.

“Those that you see over there,” responded his master, “with the long arms—some
of them almost two leagues long.”

“Look, your grace,” responded Sancho, “what you see over there aren’t giants—they’re
windmills; and what seems to be arms are the sails that rotate the millstone when
they’re turned by the wind.”

“It seems to me,” responded don Quixote, “that you aren’t well-versed in adventures—they
are giants; and if you’re afraid, get away from here and start praying while I go
into fierce and unequal battle with them.”

And saying this, he spurred his horse Rocinante without heeding what his squire
Sancho was shouting to him, that he was attacking windmills and not giants. But
he was so certain they were giants that he paid no attention to his squire Sancho’s
shouts, nor did he see what they were, even though he was very close. Rather, he
went on shouting: “Do not flee, cowards and vile creatures, for it’s just one knight
attacking you!”
